# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

- Version control is an archive created to preserve an accessable history of contact, modification, alteration of code meant for sharing. It allows you to see the code through time. This is very precticle because you get a very large context for what the code what designed for, by who, and how. This allows for the code to be richly developed, perpetually. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

-A branch is relatively a "safe" space where you can edit or modify your code without affecting the original source material. It serve as a comparative timeline tool. Many people can work on the same code at once with out getting in each other way. you can branch a very complex project into many different segments, assign the them to many people, and the merge them together. its very efficient.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

-A commit is a save point, a finalization, where you submit your changes along with a message explaining in your own best clarity what your intentions were. A good commit message should never need explaining.

* What is a merge conflict?

-A merge is when you combine modified, or altered code to a pre-existing version of itself. Sometimes, there are logic issues with the way the language is structured, they way you've written the code, and wether it can be expressed in git. If git can resolve what you have written and are trying to merge, it will notify you that it has a "merge conflict". It seems to me like a an expression of where you've navigated outside of the logic capacity of the language???
