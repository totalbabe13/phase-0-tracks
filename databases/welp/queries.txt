** There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews INNER JOIN users ON user_id = users.id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON business_id = businesses.id;
