//write a function that takes an array of words or phrases 
//and returns the longest word or phrase in the array. 

//So if we gave your function the array of 
//["long phrase","longest phrase","longer phrase"], 
//it would return "longest phrase". 

//This is a logical reasoning challenge,
// so try to reason through this based on what you already know, 
//rather than Googling the fanciest solution or 
//looking up built-in sorting functions. 
//Note that "some string".length will do what you expect in JS.
//Add driver code that tests your function on a few arrays.


//create an array with many different length strings

//access each string in the array

//count the length of each string

//compare lengths of each tring 

//select the longest string,
