#write an algorithm where a robot uses an elevator in Pseudocode

#----

# (assuming that your already standing infornt of the elevator.)


#Lift hand and push button UNTIL the button light has turn on.

#Wait UNTIL doors open. IF doors open, walk in and turn around.

#Recall the NUMBER of the floor you're going to

#Face the new button panel(with numbers)

# Buying coffee:

#ENTER the coffee shop
#SEARCH for the CASH register
#move towards it UNTIL you are in front
#ASK is anybody here?
	#IF no one is present, 
	#WAIT UNTIL ATTTENDANT = present
