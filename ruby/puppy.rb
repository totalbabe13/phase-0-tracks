In phase-0-tracks/ruby/puppy_methods.rb:

Add driver code at the bottom that initializes an instance of Puppy, and verify that your instance can now fetch a ball. Run the file from the command line to check your work.
Add a speak method that takes an integer, and then prints "Woof!" that many times.
Add a roll_over method that just prints "*rolls over*".
Add a dog_years method that takes an integer (of human years) and converts that number to dog years, returning a new integer.
Add one more trick -- whichever one you'd like.
If you haven't already, update your driver code to demonstrate that all of these methods work as expected.
